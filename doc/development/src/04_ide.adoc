=== IntelliJ

The following plugins might be useful:

* Git Conflict
* GitToolBox
* google-java-format
* JRebel
* Maven Helper
* SonarLint
* Spotbugs
* Spring Tools
* Spring Boot
* Save Actions

==== Start in IntelliJ

You can choose "Spring Boot" and then configure:

* Main class: com.thieme.doctor.Application
* Active profiles: mock (or the profile you want)

==== Start in IntelliJ Community

Start the Application as normal Java Application

* Configure the argument for the profile: --spring.profiles.active=mock

==== Configuration

You have different configuration in this application, one default for production and one spring profile ```mock``` to
mock e.g. the erp server:

[source]
----
> mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=mock
----

and in the ide you can add a new 'run configuration' with 'Active profiles' = 'mock'. If you configure nothing, you
start with the production system.
