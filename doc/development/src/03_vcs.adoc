=== Commit Rule

The commit message must always adhere to the following structure

[source]
----
#111 commit-message
----

The number should be the ticket number.

_Smart would be this rule:_<br>
Format: `#<ticket-number> - <type>: <subject>`

Example:

[source]
----
#111 - feat: add hat wobble
^--^   ^--^  ^------------^
|         |     |
|         |     +-> Summary in present tense.
|         |
|         +-------> Type: chore, docs, feat, fix, refactor, style, or test.
+-> ticket-number
----

- `feat`: (new feature for the user, not a new feature for build script)
- `fix`: (bug fix for the user, not a fix to a build script)
- `docs`: (changes to the documentation)
- `style`: (formatting, missing semi colons, etc; no production code change)
- `refactor`: (refactoring production code, eg. renaming a variable)
- `test`: (adding missing tests, refactoring tests; no production code change)
- `chore`: (updating grunt tasks etc; no production code change)

=== Branch Rule

[source]
----
typ/123_some_text
----

- `typ`: feature or fix
- `123_some_text`: summary in present tense
