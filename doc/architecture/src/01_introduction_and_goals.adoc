== Introduction and Goals
For the agile process the interface to the backend will change very often, so there is a 'backend for frontend' (BFF), so that we do not change in every sprint the api interface. We have a consistent api interface to the BFF and data format, so the BFF handle the api changes from the backend. So the Adapter will do the following:

* Call the relevant ECP API
* Ensures a fixed frontend api
* Format the data based on the frontend representation
* Send the formatted data to the frontend

|Quality|Motivation
| _Efficiency_ | _The Adapter should be fast and doing only adapter/format stuff._
| _Understandability_ | _The Adapter should be simple, so that non java experts can develop there._
| _Testability_ | _The architecture should allow easy testing of all main building blocks._
