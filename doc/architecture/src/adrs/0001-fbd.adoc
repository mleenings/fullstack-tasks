=== File Based Database

Date: 2022-01-01

==== Status
Accepted

==== Context
First approach was a Docker Container with a MongoDB, but at the start of the project it was not possible to install docker. So we will choose a different MongoDB similar DB without a Docker Container or big database overhead.

==== Decision
JsonDB is a lightweight Json-file database.

==== Consequences
File-system database is not central, but for this example it is good enough.
